# RBBreaker
This is a collection of tools to break the game Reality Break.  
Certain tools **will** break when game update.

-----

## [Parallel Reality (game version 1.00.1)](ParallelReality)
Basically a mod loader.

Version: **1.1 (2025.04.11)**

-----

## [RBWatcher (game version 1.00.1)](RBWatcher)
This tool is used to "watch" various values in the game.  

Why?  
Someone want to create autosplitter.
I'm not experience in these kind of tools but I hope I can at least help with providing a place to get the internal game data.

### Current state: Proof of concept.

Launch game, run this tool, and each time you input the command `read` it will print out:
- Pilot Name
- Current Cycle
- Current Map Name

If you have any issue or request, create an Issue or find me on Reality Break's discord server, on #modding channel.
If you have time to spare and want to improve the tool, please create a PR.
